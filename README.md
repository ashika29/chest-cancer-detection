# chest-cancer-detection

Well, the aim of this project was to understand how to process data, transform it, use it, tweak and get results out of it.
I tried to build a model, with clear understand, as how to achieve good results but as of 26 Oct 2020, the accuracy proves that its a flop show. But yes, this is a checkpoint to see as to how I can improve the model to gain good accuracy and precision!!!
